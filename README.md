Extraction and data manipulation tool supporting Synopsys' Sentaurus TCAD

This repository contains all the required files for the extraction and manipulation of data files generated by and supporting
Synopsys' Sentaurus TCAD and it's sub-tools for transistor designing

Basic requirements-
1) Perl
2) GNU Octave

After unzipping the folder in any location, run the tcad_stable file or use the terminal to run any specific program.
All programs are well documented using comments wherever necessary.

Note:If GNU Octave does not run well with the tcad, it's probably because Octave is unable to create a workspace automatically
in the location of the tcad. Solve it by creating a workspace yourself or give run tcad_stable with root access(on unix like 
operating systems)
